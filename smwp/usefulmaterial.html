                <h2>Hot and cold</h2>
                <p>Hide an object, like a paper note. But this object could be anything.  Have a pen?  Perfect.  A CTR ring borrowed from a child?  That works too. Have one child go out of the room, hide the object, have the child come back in as the children sing start singing.  Have the children sing loud when the seeker is close to the object.  Have them sing quieter as the seeker is farther away.
                This is a classic and NEVER gets old!</p>

                <h2>Voice changer</h2>
                <p>Do you have a song that you need to sing over and over again to practice?  Write these different ways to sing on the board.  Pick a child who is reverent and let them choose.  Change the singing voice to that style for the song.
                    -Computer Robot (staccato).
                    -Baby voice (sweet and cuddly)
                    -Child's voice (hold the nose, or move the index finger up and down on the lips)
                    -Opera (self-explanatory - uses hand actions as well!
                    -Feather voice (whisper)
                    -Bee voice (buzzing)
                    -Ninja movie voice (moving mouth between words and pauses)
                    -Giant's voice (sing deep and low)</p>

                <h2>Silent singer</h2>
                <p>Ask a child to come out into the hallway.  Next, choose a Primary child who wants to be the "Silent Singer."  Have the child who is in the hallway come back in while the children sing a song.  The child who is the "Silent Singer" sings with his lips and the child who was in the hallway tries to guess which child is the "Silent Singer" before the song ends.</p>

                <h2>Reverence Meter</h2>
                <p>SMA Flair, a pinterest user, uploaded a picture of this great idea which is to make a meter to let kids know when they are making too much noise. You could promise them a gift if the whole class manages to keep the hand at "perfect" by the end of the class.</p>
